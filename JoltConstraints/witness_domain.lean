-- Rust: [remapped_ram_address](/Users/ari.biswas/Work-with-A16z/jolt/crates/jolt-witness/src/backend/trace/ram.rs:260).
-- Every nonzero RAM access must remap successfully and fit the chosen witness
-- domain. This includes device I/O. Rust treats raw address zero as no access;
-- a nonzero address below the layout's lowest address is an error, not padding.
-- This is a condition on witness parameters and the recorded execution, not an
-- extra ISA execution rule. It covers every actual row, before witness padding.
